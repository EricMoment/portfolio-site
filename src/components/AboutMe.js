      Greetings! I am Stan Moment, a Vietnamese Junior Web Engineer based in Tokyo. 
      I graduated in Accounting and worked in the industry for a year before thinking of changing my career to Web Development. 
      I self-learned HTML, CSS, React and I am currently learning the back-end Express.js. 
      I love using data and logic to tackle problems, and programming helps to do exactly that. 
      I am excited to pursue a position as a Junior Web Engineer and apply my skills in developing and maintaining web services.
      Meanwhile, I am also learning Japanese with aim to passing JLPT N2.
